Thank you for your interest in helping improve the security of Kubernetes.

Kubernetes is an open-source project, and does not have customers or regularly send emails from the kubernetes.io domain. As such, we do not believe that the current configuration of our SPF record poses a threat to the project or its users. If you believe you have discovered a particular instance in which the configuration of our SPF record can be used to harm a specific user or the project, please supply additional details.

Thank you,

The Kubernetes Security Response Committee
